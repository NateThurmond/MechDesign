# MechDesign
This project is a site developed in Node JS to allow players of the board game "BattleTech" to customize and design their mechs. It is a work in progress.

# Overview
The site started out as a project for school because I noticed the lack of any well designed site that allows users
to customize mechs for the boardgame battletech. The first site was handled in php and 
javascript and worked well enough but I would like this site to have improved functionality
and also explore different options using MongoDB and Node JS.

# Features
 - The site will cover the introductory rule set for the board game battletech.
 - It will allow users to customize, save, and load battlemechs.
 - It will allow users to export their mechs as a pdf printout.
